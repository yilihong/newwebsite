## Monitor I Use
I use the [LG Ultrafine 5K Monitor](https://amzn.to/375qd7m). It is absolutely a workhorse. I think everyone should have one!

## Keyboard I use
I use a keyboard from the [Gray Studio](https://graystudio.club) called Space65, and a keyboard from the Percent Studio called Canoe.

## Mouse I use
I use the [Logitech G703 Lightspeed Wireless Mouse](https://amzn.to/2ZizR3P), which is super precise and responsive.
