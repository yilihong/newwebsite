The W. P. Carey Magazine recently wrote a story about our paper on the local economic conditions and participation in the gig economy (with Nina Huang from ASU, Gord Burtch from UMN, and Paul Pavlou from Temple U). Please see the story [here](https://news.wpcarey.asu.edu/20180910-insiderâ€™s-guide-money), and if you are interested, a copy of the working paper can be downloaded [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3105090).
