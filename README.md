============

This is my personal/academic website. It is an open source project hosted on Github at [https://yilihong.github.io](https://yilihong.github.io) and powered by Jekyll.

The layout and look of this website are inspired by Steve Miller's No-Good-Very-Bad theme, which is in turn based on [Joel Glovier](http://joelglovier.com/)'s `jekyll-new` theme and [Alex King](http://www.alexking.org)'s [Favepersonal](https://crowdfavorite.com/favepersonal/) Wordpress theme.
